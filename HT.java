//DS used to store info with a Key(Name) and Value(Phone#)
//Hask Function>> Looks at a Key >> evaluate it & spit some index# that's going be stored somewhere in the array
//Eg: Hash(edson) = index 3 >>best index data can go in
//If collision is found, it creates a LinkedList on that same index position
//Taking a key value it brings the index position in the array.
//Fast in insertion and sorting to an array iwith limited size
